# Sakura Shader

Sakura Shader is our own shader that I uses to create the Particle Live / VRMV.  
It is intended for use with VRChat and/or VR-HMD, and does not use the shader keywords and think about parallax (if needed).  
Sakura Shader has the following variants:

-   Lyrics
-   Particles
-   ScreenFX
-   Skybox
-   Stencil Write
-   Unlit
