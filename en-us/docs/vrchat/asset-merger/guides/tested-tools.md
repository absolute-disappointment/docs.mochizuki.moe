I have confirmed that Asset Merger works properly with asset generated by the following assets:

-   [VRC3AvatarTools](https://gatosyocora.booth.pm/items/2207020){target=\_blank}
-   [Radial Inventory System](https://yagihata.booth.pm/items/2278448){target=\_blank}
-   [Fukidashi System for Avatars 3.0](https://natsuneko.booth.pm/items/2149045){target=\_blank}

However, I have confirmed that the file size is significantly reduces when the Animator Controller created by VRC3AvatarTools combined, but I have confirmed the behaviour and verified that there was no problem in behaviour.
